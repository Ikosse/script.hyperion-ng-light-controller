# Hyperion-ng Light Controller
Hyperion-ng Light Controller is a Kodi add-on aiming at provding a simple and intuitive GUI, requiring minimal configuration to remotely control your Hyperion server. Simply enter IP and port number of the Hyperion server as well as protocol (http or https) into the settings menu. The add-on communicates with the Hyperion server through JSON RPC, so make sure it is active. Functions include choosing effect patterns, turning on/off LEDs, toggling platform capture (bias lighting) or any other service you have configured. Note, that this add-on is not for configuring or setting up your Hyperion server, for this purpose use the Web-UI or the CLI.
